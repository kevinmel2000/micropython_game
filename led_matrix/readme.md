# Micropython Game

----
## About

> This repository is about retrogame written in micropython to run in led matrix 8x8 display module. Remember, as micropython uses primitive framebuffer function to draw pixel and shapes, it will be very easy to port this to different  platform such as OLED or Nokia 5110. Create a fork of this repository and make something nicer.
